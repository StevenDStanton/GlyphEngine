# GlyphEngine

This is a small, badly written, text based 2D engine written in Go using the EbitEngine Library.

I wrote this in a few days during the Pirate Software Game Jam. It started out beautifully structured using all of the best practices.

You can find the game I created with it here [The Social Contract](https://apocalypsetheory.itch.io/the-social-contract)

As life happened and time grew short it became a tangled ball of mud.

still I had fun writing it, I may even come back and clean it up more in the future.

## How to Use

I will fill this in later, for now just read over the code. I removed most of the assets since they

did not belong to me. So you will need to include your own sound files in `internal/player/player.go`

You will also need to update the image references that I did not include for the intro scene in `internal/intro/intro.go`

## Why share

I had fun with it, and I am hoping someone else will find this interesting or useful and do something cool with it despite how badly written it is.
